# Bot Or Not?

My attempt at creating a binary classification machine learning model for social media spam bots.

I'm thinking about starting out with a Convolutional Neural Network.
Maybe then I can got to making a Visual Transformer (ViT) or some sort of language processing model.

### Data

Data is in `/data`.
I made my own custom dataset with Instagram posts.

### Next Steps:

- Make a graph like model - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04564.pdf
- Get different social medias
  - TikTok
  - Twitter
  - Instagram
  - SnapChat
